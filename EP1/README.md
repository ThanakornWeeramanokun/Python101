## Things that must be prepared before starting to write the code
- 1. Define the color used
- 2. Set the desired position
- 3. Determine the distance for drawing squares. (Must be balanced)

## The simple principle is
Is a drawing of each pixel continuously By starting one by one, draw all positions So start the next color
