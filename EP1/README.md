---------------------------------------------------------
I use Library Turtle for drawing Logo Minecraft!!

Things that must be prepared before starting to write the code
1. Define the color used
2. Set the desired position
3. Determine the distance for drawing squares. (Must be balanced)

The simple principle is
Is a drawing of each pixel continuously By starting one by one, draw all positions So start the next color
